# How to run
After downloading the program you can:

(RECOMMENDED) - Open the folder and run the Tetris.exe file.

(ALTERNATIVE) - Double click on .vcxproj or open it in Visual Studio. Then run Local Windows Debugger or press F5.

# Requirements (if ALTERNATIVE was chosen)
1. Download SFML 2.5.1 ( https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ )
2. Put the "SFML-2.5.1" file in your (C:) drive

# Easy future use (if ALTERNATIVE was chosen)
After running the program once a debug folder will be created. Copy and paste all "sfml-xyz.dll" and "openal32.dll" files into it, then do the same for
"Fonts" folder (not the contents in them, just the folders). you can now run the exe file or a shortcut any time.
